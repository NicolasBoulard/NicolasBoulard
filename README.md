### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a DevOps and automation enthusiast with a strong focus on cloud-native technologies and scalable infrastructure.

I enjoy building efficient systems that reduce manual intervention and enable rapid development cycles. My main interests revolve around:

- Container orchestration with Kubernetes and its ecosystem (Helm, ArgoCD, etc.)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
- Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
- CI/CD pipelines and workflow automation
- Scripting and tooling with Python, Bash, and TypeScript

I'm driven by curiosity, clean architecture, and the desire to continuously learn and iterate. Whether it's automating a small workflow or deploying a full-scale platform, I always aim for simplicity, reliability, and clarity.
